            What is HTML???
          </h2>
          <p>
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page 
            and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, 
            a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage
            and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the
            structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the
            appearance of the document.

          <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs,
            images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the
            rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting
            structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes
            and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
            Tags such as <img /> and <input /> directly introduce content into the page. 
            Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may
            include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them
            to interpret the content of the page
          </p>
